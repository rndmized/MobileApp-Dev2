# Block Breaker: Reborn

Classic arkanoid game with sensor features allowing the user to tilt their phone to direct the paddle left or right accordingly. Randomly generated stages and data persistence for scores. Its purpose is to present a challenge by rewarding the user with more points at increased speed, allowing them to improve their scores in a completely random generated environment. It penalizes reducing the speed by earning less point per block broken.

It has been created accomplishing the following requiremens:
```
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated 
Storage and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. These include: 

* Accelerometer or Gyroscope 
* GPS (Location Based Services)
* Sound
* Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)
* Camera
* Multi Touch Gesture Management

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the 
question  “why will the user open this app for a second time?”
```
